SNAKES AND LADDERS SIMULATION
==================================

This is a simple, configurable Snake and Ladders game simulator.
The simulator runs a specified (configurable) number of times,
and collects a set of statistics and prints on the screen.

In this early stages it is still unoptimized in various areas.

REQUIREMENTS:
    - Python3


CONFIGURE:
All the configuration is read from this file in the root of the project:
    - game.conf

Following aspects of the simulator are configurable:
    - Number of times to run the simulator
    - Number of players
    - Number and placement of snakes
    - Number and placement of ladders

The above mentioned configuration file has a running, working set of values
and also has instructions on how to change any.


USAGE:
To run, type following on the command line - while in the root of the project
directory:

python3 snake_ladder_simulation.py


TEST:
The bundled tests are written with pytest and can be run with following
command - while in the root of the project directory:

pytest --verbose

The simulator has been so far tested on, and known to work on
    - Apple MacOS
    - Fedora Linux


NOTES:
* Among others, some of the restrictions on the configuration of the snakes and the ladders include:
    - A snake or a ladder spanning the entire board is not allowed
    - Placing a snake on the winning position (100) is not allowed
    - A snake or a ladder not spanning a row (i.e. horizontal) are not allowed
     (This restriction is only to maintain aesthatics of the game board)
    In the current implementation, simulator notifies and halts upon detecting the above conditions
* Lucky move is counted twice in a single move in the following cases:
    -   If a snake's head is positioned at 98 or 99, arriving at the winnig position (100)
        from any position 97 or less is counted 'lucky' twice
    -   If a players arrives at the bottom of a ladder, and if that also happens to be one
        or two positions away from a snake's head than two 'lucky' moves are counted
* Within a die-roll-streak (triggered by a roll of 6):
    -   In case of a die-roll-streak, e.g. [6,6,2], each chance encounter with a snake
        or a ladder for every single roll within that streak is honored
* Bounce back:
    If a player rolls more than the last n required to win, then the token will be bounced back
    eg. a player on 97 (who needs 3 to win) rolls 5 will bounce back to 98 (100-2)
