# ASSUMPTION
# Start Position
# It appears typo in the spec, the start position is mistakenly mentioned to be 0
# Looking at the board diagram it should have been 1

#
# The longest turn
# The longest turn is recorded such that it could be of any of the players, not necessarily the winner
#

# SPECIAL CASES
#
# Bounce back:
# If a player rolls more than the last n required to win, will bounce back
# eg. a player on 97 (who needs 3 to win) rolls 5 will bounce back to 98 (100-2)

# TODO: Decide to type hint all the way or not. Comment accordingly
# Concious decision to not use type hint. My own opinion, would prefer to but not in this small exercise. Happy to adapt to team's adapter practices
